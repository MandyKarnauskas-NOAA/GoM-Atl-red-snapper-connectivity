Master set of codes for FATE project:  
USE OF A BIOPHYSICAL MODELING FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP A RECRUITMENT INDEX FOR INCLUSION IN STOCK ASSESSMENTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SOUTH ATLANTIC

CMS output files (traj_files and con_files) are very large and are not stored here.

CMS_input_files folder has final CMS files used in simulations.  

Contains codes needed to reproduce results, building off species distribution maps

Also contains post-processing codes for plotting results and figures

CMSreleasefile_Tortugas.r  	for creating release file for Tortugas simulation
post_proc_Hatteras_Tortugas.r 	postprocessing and figures for smaller-scale simulations (Hatteras and Tortugas)
RS_CMS_releasefile_GoM_SAtl.r 	for building release files for Gulf and Atlantic, from distribution map outputs
post_proc_GoM_ATL.r  		postprocessing for full Gulf-Atlantic simulations
