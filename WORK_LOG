Dug up old settlement polygon file, refined polygons in Atl to match resolution in Gulf

12June2019
ran ATL simulations and put in new folder: runGulf_HYCOM150
* note - error with 2009 in GoM runs 0 - throwing -5 exit code for some dates (missing oc data -why??) 
* only 2008 run with Atlantic

added some additional checks to post_proc_GoM_Atl code - screening traj_files for random errors



11June2019
- cleaned up file names, organized in MASTER_codes folder and cleaned up codes
  ** changed code for assigning depth of spawning -- now specific to hydrodynamic nest to avoid (-1) exit code error
  ** release files now have nest descriptor in filename (e.g., RS_ATL_releaseHatteras_HYCOM150.txt)

New files: 
	nest_1_20080501000000_HYCOM150.nc	HYCOM 1/50 degree nest for depth extract
	RS_ATL_release_HYCOM150.txt		updated release file for entire Atlantic based on egg production map, using HYCOM 1/50 nest
	RS_ATL_releaseHatteras_HYCOM150.txt	updated release file for Hatteras hotspot based on egg production map, using HYCOM 1/50 nest
	RS_ATL_releaseMain_HYCOM150.txt		updated release file for Atlantic S of 34N based on egg production map, using HYCOM 1/50 nest
	RS_CMS_releasefile_ATL.r		release file building off Atlantic statistical egg production map
	RS_CMS_releasefile_GoM.r		release file building of MCF paper SSB distribution 
	RS_CMS_releasefile_Tortugas.r		release file building off SEAMAP reef fish video survey sent by Matt Campbell on Mon, Mar 11, 12:57 PM
